## A* Search Experiment

Sequence: 

_PredictedTimeToComplete, ActualTimetoComplete, Objective,_  
<1, 5, ~~There is a X*Y grid,~~  
<1, , There are agents,  
<1, , An agent can occupy  a coordinate in the grid,  
<1, , The grid can have blocked coordinate: blocked coordinatecan not be occupied by agents,  
<1, , The grid can have a goal coordinate: when the goal coordinate reached the game ends,  
<1, , The grid can have a failure coordinate: when the failure coordinate is reached the game end,s   
<1, , The agent can move from once space to another, as long as the it is not occupied.  
<1, , When the game ends the optimal path calculated by A* Search is animated,  
<1, , There is a button that when pressed the optimal path calculated by A* Search is animated

~Levels can be designed and played
